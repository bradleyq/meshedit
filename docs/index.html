<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>I wrote a curve calculating and mesh loading program that allows for rendering of Bezier curves and dae triangle meshes.
  The program also includes normal calculations and mesh editing features through the help of halfedge datastructures. I learned how the 
  correct use of data structures can allow for efficient modification of meshes (especially subdivision).

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

<p> De Casteljau's algorithm is an algorithm to intuitively find points of a Bezier curve with respect to a parametric t. I implemented it
using a loop to constantly lerp between adjacent points (with param t) in the previous layer until there is one point remaining. This point 
is a point on the Berzier curve by de Casteljau's algorithm.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

<p>
  De Casteljau's can be extended to surfaces by running the algorithm on one axis first, then the other. I first used de Casteljau's on the u
  axis with the u parameter to find the Bezier points at u for all v values. I then run de Casteljau's on these points with parameter v to find
  the final Bezier surface point at (u,v).

<h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
<p>
  The normal at the vertex is the weighted average of the normals of its surrounding faces. I implemented it by utilizing properties of
  cross products. The normals of the surrounding faces can be calculated by a cross product of two if the edges of that face. It also 
  happens that the magnitude of the product is proportional to the area of the surface. Thus, taking the sum of consistent 
  (all clockwise or counterclockwise) cross products of adjacent edges into the vertex will give the direction of the normal at that 
  vertex. Normalizing the sum will give the unit normal for the vertex.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
<p>
  I implemented edge flips with pure pointer reassignment operations:
  <ul>
    <li>get pointers to every edge in the triangle pair ( I flipped the center edge clockwise since it avoids reassigning face of that edge)</li>
    <li>assign correct faces to halfedges</li>
    <li>assign vertex halfedges to perimeter edges</li>
    <li>point face halfedge to corresponding flipped halfedge</li>
    <li>point the flipped edge next to correct destinations</li>
    <li>reassign flipped edge vertex to correct new vertex</li>
    <li>reassign perimeter next pointers</li>
  </ul>
  I did not use any loops or branches to improve speed and simplicity. I debugged by constantly flipping edges adjacent to each other to
  test their behavior (any disappearing faces/edges).
</p>
  <div align="middle">
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
           <img src="images/image12.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Rendering teapot no flips.</figcaption>
      </td>

        <figcaption align="middle">Rendering teapot with flips.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>
What took me the longest to figure out was the need to reassign the halfedge of vertices and faces. My first implementation did not reassign
these pointers and thus, had disappearing faces that would reappear after a certain number of flips. Eventually I realized what was wrong
when analyzing the pointers of the faces and vertices after flips.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
<p>
  I implemented edge splits much the same way I did the flips. I just hardcoded the pointer reassignments and object creations:
<ul>
  <li>get pointers to every edge in the triangle pair</li>
  <li>create six new halfedges</li>
  <li>create three new edges</li>
  <li>create two new faces</li>
  <li>create one new vertex</li>
  <li>reassign vertex halfedges to perimeter edges</li>
  <li>assign face halfedges to perimeter edges</li>
  <li>assign correct halfedges for new edges</li>
  <li>setNeighbors for all halfedges</li>
  <li>set position of new vertex</li>
  <li>label new vertex as new. Assign its new position to the one of the split edge. reset split edge new position</li>
  <li>label new cross edge as new</li>
</ul>
  I found drawing a labeled diagram helpful for this part since there are a lot of pointers to keep track of. Debugging was pretty uneventful
  since I was more careful due to my experience with flip. The new position code was added later from part 6 as it is much easier to deal with
  transferring positions and labeling vertices when we still have pointers to the new vertices during creation.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
<p>
  Loop subdivision was done in five passes.<br><br>
  First pass is a pass over all vertices. It sets all the vertex new statuses to 'false.' It also computes the new position of the vertices by 
  using the weighing rules shown in lecture. Weights are also stored using DP to theoretically improve speed.<br><br>
  Second pass is a pass over all edges. It sets all the edge new statuses to 'false.' It also computes the new position of the edge center by
  using the weighing rules shown in lectore. Weights are hardcoded.<br><br>
  Third pass is a pass over all edges. It splits every edge. Since we are guaranteed an orientable, manifold mesh, we do not need to worry about
  splitting edges or incorrect winding. Thus, we can just split everything. It is here that new cross edges are marked and positions are transferred
  from edges to new vertices. We know when to stop splitting by checking for the first instance of a new edge in the edge iterator since the first
  edge added to the iterator by my algorithm is a new edge and the iterator always appends to the end. (note: only the 2 new cross edges are labeled new.
  The extension of the original edge is not labeled new)<br><br>
  Fourth pass is a pass over all edges. It flips all edges that were marked as new whose one endpoint is new and the other old. It also sets all
  new edge statuses to false for a safety measure. <br><br>
  Fifth pass is a pass over all vertices. It sets all positions of verticies to their new positions. It also resets new position variable for good
  measure.
</p>
<p>
  When we subdivied with loop subdivision, we lose sharp corners and edges. This is because of the averaging of the vertices during every subdivision.
  This loss of sharpness can be mitigated by bunching many vertices at sharp edges and corners to preserve overall position of the corner or edge.

<p>
  When we subdivide the cube model many times, it becomes asymmetric because the vertices have different degrees and positions of adjacent vertices.
  This changes the weighing calculations and thus creates asymmetry. Fix the asymmetry by preprocessing the cube mesh to be symmetrical edge wise.
  This helps because each corner vertex now has the same degree and has adjacent vertices identically distributed with respect to the origin (center).
